 # Faceswap Bot

This is a script that performs a face swap on two random images collected from SPB repository, built on top of the work done by Matthew Earl (@matthewearl).
After performing the face swap (both ways), it joins the resulting images and posts to Facebook, on the page I created.

Feel free to use this code for fun or to create your own bot! I intend to make it a little bit more user friendly in the future, so it'll be easier to have fun with it!

## How to use

I suggest you use an advanced text editor, sucha as Atom, to view and edit the script as you need, and then run it on a terminal emulator. You can, of course, use any IDE you want, or even windows notepad.

Simply run the script, change the variables at the beggining if you want to post to FB, show the final image, or both.

### Prerequisites

For the script to work, you need:
* A valid installation of Python 3.X
* [dlib](https://pypi.org/project/dlib/) and its python bindings
* [The tained model](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dclib/postdownload)
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org) and its python bindings
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Facebook python API](https://facebook-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
